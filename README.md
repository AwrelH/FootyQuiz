## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    As a user I want to play a quiz that is straight forward. 
    This is the question and those are the alternatives. I want to see how I progress while playing and at some point the game will let me know that the game if finished. I want to be challenged with questions that regards football and hopfully learn something. 



-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -  the colorscheme I have used 
        
        ![](assets/images/forREADME/colors.png)
        
            I've used the HSL set-up because its efficent way to grade up and down through the colors. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font family I've used is Kanita, PT Sans Narrow, Sansita, sans-serif.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I've used a banner image of a stadium and a ball on top, behind the welcome-text. And the additional imagery is soly complementing some of the questions where I found it adding value to the questions, flags for countries for example.
