## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User story

    As a user I want to play a quiz that is straight forward. 
    This is the question and those are the alternatives. I want to see how I progress while playing and at some point the game will let me know that the game if finished. I want to be challenged with questions that regards football and hopefully learn something. 



-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -  the color scheme I have used.
        
        ![](assets/images/forREADME/colors.png)
        
            I've used the HSL set-up because its efficent way to grade up and down through the colors. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font family I've used is Kanita, PT Sans Narrow, Sansita, sans-serif.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I've used a banner image of a stadium and a ball on top, behind the welcome-text. And the additional imagery is only complementing some questions where I found it adding value to the questions, flags for countries for example. 
    -   #### Two CSS-files
        -   I created two different CSS files to separate them because some of it was a not needed in contact.html and gave a better workflow. 
*   ### Wireframes

    -   Home Page Wireframe - [View](assets/images/forREADME/footyQuizDesktop.png), clearly some changes that came along the project, removing of the highscore and suggestion textarea. Suggestion is added in separate page.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
-   [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used top import fonts into the style.css file which is used on both pages.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control, use of commands as git add, git commit, git push. 
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to start the project via code Institute template, and was coded on gitpod.io. 

1. [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the start of project.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the pages of the project and make sure code is correct. Also JSHint was used to validate the JavaScript. And Chrome Lighthouse devtool was used as well.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - no errors were found doing test.

-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - one error were found regarding background-position that was applied twice within one selector. 

- [JSHint code quality tool](https://jshint.com/) - No warnings were hinted. Some metrics that was returned:

    - There are 6 functions in this file.

    - Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 0.5.

    - Largest function has 14 statements in it, while the median is 5.5.

    - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 3 while the median is 1.5.

    Also says one unused variable, line 63, but it's used in the HTML with 'onclick'. 



- [Lighthouse via pagespeed ](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) - tested my project through Lighthouse with good results. Only real question marks were the banner-image that was too big and creates an excessive load time, image is now more compressed and contrast between the 'contact'-link and the background, when the page loads with the overlay transparency. ![](assets/images/forREADME/lighthouseReport.PNG)

### Debugging
    A bug that appeared that I discoved was when changing all the innerHTML to innerText. This made my buttons not display images and it took a little time but after a while I got it and changed it back. Why I changed it in the first case is because I heard/read something about XSS attacks. Most changes could stay but on the buttons had to go. 

### Tests
-   The Website was tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. Also on Samsung s10e and Huawei MediaPad T5.
-   The website was also viewed on a variety of devices from Desktop, Laptop, and phone and pad from the set-up that is available on the developer tools in these browsers. 

### Unfixed errors / possible changes

With some late changes to code I wanted to display the answers to user but with shortage of time I was unable to display the answers and the questions in a fashion that I wanted for the user.  
For example: instead of Question 1: You answered correct d, What I wanted was: Question 1: Who are the WC title holders? You answered correct, France. 

## Deployment
### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Go to GitHub and locate the [right repository](https://github.com/AwrelH/FootyQuiz)
2. Go to "`settings`" on the menu.  
3. Click on "`Pages`" Section.
4. Under "`Source`", change the dropdown option from "`None`" to "`main`".
5. Save the changes and let github do its work.
